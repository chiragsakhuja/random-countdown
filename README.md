# Random Countdown Timer

This web application implements a random countdown timer that triggers an alarm at a random time within a user-defined range. The timer automatically restarts after the alarm, making it ideal for activities requiring randomized intervals.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer Range**: Users can specify minimum and maximum countdown times in seconds.
- **Randomized Countdown**: The timer selects a random duration within the specified range.
- **Alarm Notification**: An alarm sound plays for 3 seconds when the countdown ends.
- **Visual Feedback**: A bell icon is displayed and animated during the alarm.
- **Automatic Restart**: The timer restarts automatically after the alarm, unless stopped manually.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the minimum and maximum countdown times (in seconds) in the input fields.
3. Click the "Start Timer" button to begin the countdown.
4. The alarm will ring when the random time is reached, and the timer will restart automatically.
5. To stop the timer, click the "Stop Timer" button.

## Dependencies
